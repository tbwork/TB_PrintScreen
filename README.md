# TB_PrintScreen
-----------------------------------------------What is it?-------------------------------------------- 

This software is used to print screen efficiently. I finished it in 2011 spring. In that time, I was confident to say my print screen software is one of the most efficient. Only QQ's print screen can be on a par with it. Even today (2015,1), the same function of Alibaba's AliWangWang is too low efficient to compare with it.


-----------------------------------------------What is new in it?----------------------------------------------

It reveals:
(1) The QQ-PrintScreen's principle.

(2) What is the best way to draw on the Windows' canvases.

(3) How to make a memo or edit control be self-adaptive when the user is typing in.

(4) How to draw your 8-node drag handle and make them useful.

(5) How to draw different shapes in canvas.(you should be creative and patient).

(6) How to draw a gray mask on a picture.

...more.

-----------------------------------------------What is it used for?-------------------------------------------- 

This software is not for directly use in your development. I share it to show all interested friends the most efficient way to build a print-screen software. In 2011, I was a college student and not familiar with design mode or even object-oriented development. But in it, some fantastic functions are implemented. Hope you can get what you want here!


----------------------------------------------How to use it?---------------------------------------------------

(1) This project was built by C++ Builder 6.0. If you want to compile it, you need to install the IDE. 

(2) If you just want to know the algorithms, you can spend your time in those .cpp files.
