# Introduction

This software is not for directly use in your development. I finished it in 2011 spring. It demonstrates one possible efficient way to build a print-screen software.
Due to that I was a newbie in terms of design mode in 2011, so the codes are not so friendly in reading. You can mainly focus on the Main.cpp file in which many useful methods, routines are implemented. Hope you can get what you want here!

# What is it?

This software is used to print screen efficiently which was finished it in 2011 spring. In that time, I was confident to say this print screen artifact is one of the most efficient. Only QQ's print screen can be on a par with it. Even today (2015,1), the print-screen module of Alibaba's AliWangWang is too low efficient to compare with it.


# What is new in it? 

It reveals:
(1) The QQ-PrintScreen's principle.

(2) What is the best way to draw on the Windows' canvases.

(3) How to make a memo or edit control be self-adaptive when the user is typing in.

(4) How to draw your 8-node drag handle and make them useful.

(5) How to draw different shapes in canvas.(you should be creative and patient).

(6) How to draw a gray mask on a picture.

...more.

# What is it used for?

This software is not for directly use in your development. I share it to show all interested friends the most efficient way to build a print-screen software. In 2011, I was a college student and not familiar with design mode or even object-oriented development. But in it, some fantastic functions are implemented. Hope you can get what you want here!


# How to use it?

(1) This project was built by C++ Builder 6.0. If you want to compile it, you need to install the IDE. 

(2) If you just want to know the algorithms, you can spend your time in those .cpp files.
